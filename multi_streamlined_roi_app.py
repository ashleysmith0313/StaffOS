9. Help us understand your business or product. What does it do and which problems does it solve? StaffOS is a unified healthcare staffing intelligence platform built for staffing firms and healthcare systems. It solves two fundamental problems: 1) It enables real-time ROI calculations for hospital executives evaluating locum tenens, nursing, and allied health staffing decisions, and 2) It offers an intuitive, ATS-integrated candidate mapping system that matches healthcare professionals to open roles based on proximity, credentialing, and facility-specific filters. StaffOS empowers both internal recruitment teams and client-facing teams with insights they’ve never had access to in one place.

10. What was the inspiration to founding the business and how does it differentiate from existing solutions? After spending over a decade in healthcare staffing—first in travel nursing recruitment during a startup’s rapid growth phase, and now in strategic account management for a leading locum tenens agency—I’ve lived every layer of the staffing lifecycle. I’ve seen how fragmented, outdated, and overly complicated tech stacks cause friction between staffing firms and their clients. Inspired by my father, a lifelong entrepreneur, -I’ve always looked for ways to elevate the room I’m in. StaffOS was born out of a desire to simplify complexity, giving frontline teams smarter tools to deliver faster, clearer value to -hospitals. Unlike existing clunky vendor tools or internal dashboards that don't speak to each other, StaffOS is purpose-built to be nimble, intuitive, and fully integratable with any ATS or VMS on the market.
